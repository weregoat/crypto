	I am going to cheat a bit here.
I assume I know already it's ECB, it's 16byte blocks, that the _role_ is at the end of the encoded string,
and the accepted input (i.e. no "=" or "&").

/* First we get the length the email address should be to have "user" in the last block"
	We cannot use "role=user" because we know the email can't have "=" or "&" in it.
We assume the structure is email=[our input]somethingsomething=user
So, we pass longer and longer mails until we get an extra block (which should be encoding "r"+padding) and we add 3 bytes ("use").
It's true that we are assuming the somethingsomething remains constant, but it's quite easy to adapt to a scenario where
the uid increases.
