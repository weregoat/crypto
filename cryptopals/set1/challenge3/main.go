/*
Single-byte XOR cipher
The hex encoded string:

1b37373331363f78151b7f2b783431333d78397828372d363c78373e783a393b3736
... has been XOR'd against a single character. Find the key, decrypt the message.

You can do this by hand. But don't: write code to do it for you.

How? Devise some method for "scoring" a piece of English plaintext. Character frequency is a good metric. Evaluate each output and choose the one with the best score.

		The suggestion to use letter frequency is a good one, in a way. But...
		when I tried to apply it it showed some issues.
		For example given the above Cyphertext I could not have the plain text,
		which is 'Cooking MC's like a pound of bacon', score the higher, no matter
		various approaches and tweaks.

		So, I got thinking on and decided to switch to words matching. Given a list
		of words (possibly the most frequent ones), score based on the numbers of them
		presents.
